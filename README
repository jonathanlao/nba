NBA Teams and their Draft Picks

## Description
Jonathan Lao's submission for the NBA's assessment for Senior CIAM Engineer

## Installation / How to run

If you use `asdf`, simply run `asdf install`.
Otherwise, make sure you have [nodejs 20.18.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed locally.

Then install local dependences via:
`npm install`

To run:
`npm run start`

Output will generated in an `output.txt` file in addition to being printed to the console.

## Testing
Run tests via:

`npm run test`

## Notes / Assumptions / Explanation of Approach
- For the purposes of the assignment, I share my API Key in the `.env` file, though obviously that would not typically be shared
- The output can be found in the `output.txt` file
- I include all teams form the `/teams` endpoint, including now defunct teams, which leads to some slightly odd data like two entries for the 'Denver Nuggets'
